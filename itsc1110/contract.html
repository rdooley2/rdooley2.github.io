        <h2>I, Ryan M. Dooley agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring
            2024, ITIS 1110 course with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I
            understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be
            available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate
            for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my
            work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,
            failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given
            the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online
            or even view my classmates’ code directly. I will only use these resources to
            learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit
            (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates. Signed: Ryan M. Dooley ,
