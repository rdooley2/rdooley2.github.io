            <h2>Contract</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                I, Ryan Dooley agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2025, ITIS 1110 Coutrse with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I pinky-promise that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
