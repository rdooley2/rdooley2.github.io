            <h3>Ryan Dooley | Student | Rowdy Dog</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> Hey, I’m Ryan! I grew up in Eden, North Carolina, but Charlotte has always felt like a second home thanks to regular visits with my great-grandmother. I’ve got one brother and a dog named Dusty, who absolutely runs the household.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Professional Experience:</strong> For the past three years, I’ve worked with UNC Charlotte’s Housing and Residence Life as a Resident Advisor — two years in Hunt Hall, one summer in Miltimore, and currently in Wilson. It’s taught me leadership, patience, and how to solve just about any problem on the fly.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I'm a senior pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and an M.S. in Cybersecurity through the early entry program here at UNC Charlotte. It’s been a challenging but incredibly rewarding journey.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Experience with the Subject:</strong> Between four years of coursework and being raised in a STEM-centered household (shoutout to my dad, who teaches high school STEM), computers and technology have been a constant part of my life. Choosing cybersecurity felt like a natural next step.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> 100% Windows. I’ve dabbled with other platforms, but Windows is home base.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Courses I’m Currently Taking and Why:</strong>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>ITIS 5246 – Competitive Cyber Defense:</strong> It’s my capstone course and the grand finale of my undergrad experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITIS 5221 – Secure Programming and Penetration Testing:</strong> A required course, but one that aligns perfectly with my future goals.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITIS 4214 – Usable Security and Privacy:</strong> I’m fascinated by the intersection of design and cybersecurity — this course hits both.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITSC 1110 – Introduction to Computer Science Principles:</strong> Taking this as a refresher and to stay sharp on foundational concepts.</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> I marched four years in high school band — tuba section. Yes, the big one. And yes, it was awesome.</li>
